Classification of MNIST Digits with SVD Decomposition.

The task for this exercise is to learn the classification of MNIST digits by using SVD decomposition.

 Given a matrix X ∈ R m×n and its SVD decomposition X = USV.T we can prove that an orthogonal base for the space of the columns is given by the first p columns of the matrix U , where p = rank(X) is equal to the number of non-zero singular values of A.

The approach is to find orthogonal projection of a test data into a subspace of X1 (or X2 or Xn) which is generated by columns of U1 (or U2 or Un). Then we calculate the projection error on each subspace and due to the minimum error we decide to put the test data into specific classifier. U1 (or Un) is the subspace related to the X columns which represents the dig
